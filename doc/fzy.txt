*fzy.txt* Neovim frontend for the fzy fuzzy finder

nvim-fzy provides a few methods to switch to files, buffers or search tags
using the fzy fuzzy finder.

It also provides a Lua API to easily customize sources and actions.



                                      Type |gO| to see the table of contents.
==============================================================================
API                                                                    *fzy-api*



execute({choices_cmd}, {on_selection}, {prompt})                  *fzy.execute()*

      This is the low-level API. It invokes the choices_cmd and opens a popup
      running fzy so that the user can make a selection.


      Parameters:
          {choices_cmd}   A shell command that must output newline separated
                          entries that form the choices.
          {on_selection}  A callback that is invoked with either `nil` if
                          the user cancelled the action, or the selection the
                          user made.
          {prompt}        Prompt text displayed in the popup.


pick_one({items}, {prompt}, {label_fn}, {cb})                    *fzy.pick_one()*

      Slightly higher level API. It takes a list of arbitrary items and a
      function to render the items to the user.

      The callback (`cb`) will receive the choice the user made or `nil`

      Parameters:
          {items}     A table (array) of arbitrary items
          {prompt}    Prompt text displayed to the user in the selection popup.
          {label_fn}  A function which will be called with an item from
                      {items} as argument and must return a text.
                      The text is what the user will see when prompted to make
                      a choice.
                      Can be `nil` in which case |vim.inspect()| will be used to
                      render the item.
          {cb}        Callback that will be invoked with the choice, or `nil`
                      if the user aborted.


actions.buffers()                                        *fzy.actions.buffers()*

      Prompts the user with all loaded buffers, once a choice is made the
      selected buffer will be opened in the current buffer.


actions.buf_tags()                                      *fzy.actions.buf_ctags()*


      Runs ctags on the current buffer and prompts the user with all generated
      tags. Once a choice is made it will navigate to the chosen tag.


actions.lsp_tags()                                      *fzy.actions.lsp_tags()*

      Retrieves tags for the current buffer using the built-in LSP client.
      Navigates to the selected symbol.


actions.quickfix()                                      *fzy.actions.quickfix()*

      Opens the items from the quickfix list.
      Navigates to the selected item.


try(...)                                                             *fzy.try()*

      Takes a list of function references and invokes them until the first succeeds.

      An example use case is `fzy.try(fzy.actions.lsp_tags, fzy.actions.buf_tags)`
      It first tries to use `lsp_tags`, but if it fails - for example because
      no LSP client/server is available - it falls back to ctags.


sinks.edit_file                                           *fzy.sinks.edit_file*


      A callback that can be used with |fzy.execute()|. It invokes `:e` on the
      selection.

      Example usage:
      >
          fzy.execute('git ls-files', fzy.sinks.edit_file)
